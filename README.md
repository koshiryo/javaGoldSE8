# javaGoldSE8

## Background
I passed the Oracle Java SE 8 Programmer II（Gold）exam with a 93%. I used two books in Japanese and for a deeper understanding I also wacthed some online tech videos in Chinese. In short, this repository is a practice for this exam.

## Overview
There are 160+ code demo in this repository.
The demos are from the Japanese books and some Chinese Text books for java. Even though the books have a fully explanation to each questions, as in my opinion "Theory must not be divorced from practice", I decided to write the code by myself for a deeper understanding.
